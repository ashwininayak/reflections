		REFLECTIONS

q:How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
ans:it identified with change in parameter and parameter that doesn't match with previous one .
what are the changes applied to it .

how could having easy acces to the entire history of afile make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

ans : it helps in bug fixing as well as better managing techniques when working with groups.
organises stuffs quiet efficiently .

what do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit ,like you do in git , vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

ans:Pros:
it gives a better command over whether to add changes to the existing file or not .
a better understanding of what changes can produce .

cons :
user need to always be aware of whether the version is being saved or not before any further step or due to some failure they can loose the file

what do you think some version control systems, like Git,allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
